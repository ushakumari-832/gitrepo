# Copilot System Uptime Script

## Overview

This repository contains a simple Python script, `copilot_test.py`, generated with the help of GitHub Copilot Chat Assistant. The script prints the system uptime in a user-friendly format, supporting both Windows and Unix/Linux systems.

## Experience Using Copilot

### What code did Copilot generate?

Copilot generated a cross-platform Python script to print system uptime. It checks the operating system and runs the appropriate command:
- On Windows: uses `net stats srv` to find uptime.
- On Unix/Linux: uses `uptime -p` to display uptime in a readable format.

### Did you modify the script?

No significant modifications were needed. The script generated by Copilot worked as intended for both Windows and Unix/Linux systems.  
If you make changes (for example, to improve formatting or error handling), please document them here.

### How did you test the script?

I tested the script by running it on my system using the instructions below.  
- On Linux, it correctly displayed the uptime.  
- On Windows, it printed the system uptime information as expected.  
If you encounter issues, make sure Python is installed and accessible from your command line.

## How to Run the Script

1. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended).
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing `copilot_test.py`.
5. Run the script using:

```bash
python copilot_test.py
```

You should see the system uptime printed in your terminal.
